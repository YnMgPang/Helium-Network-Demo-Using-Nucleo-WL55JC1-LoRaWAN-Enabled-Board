# Helium-Network-Demo-Using-Nucleo-WL55JC1-LoRaWAN-Enabled-Board
 
 Goals of this project:
 1) connect and send data to the Helium Network
 2) control temperature sensor using the Nucleo board and transmit data through the network
 3) experiment with RTOS
 4) implement low-power mode
 
 
 Progress and Issues:  
 1)   
 a - weak node transmit signal -> Gateway received signal's RSSI is constanly < -110dBm.  
 b - stable but "periodic" node receive signal -> OTTA activations can only be archieved during nighttime.  
 1+)  
 a - retry and confirm signal strength pattern  
 b - assess practicality of continuing this project in the current location  
 
 
 *Notes
 - WL55JC1 and WL55JC2 work in different regions according to local radio policies.
