# Helium-Network-Demo-Using-Nucleo-WL55JC1-LoRaWAN-Enabled-Board
 
 Goals of this project:
 a) connect and send data to the Helium Network
 b) control temperature sensor using the Nucleo board and transmit data through the network
 c) experiment with RTOS
 c++) sensor tasks, serial output tasks
 d) implement low-power mode
 
 
 Progress and Issues:  
 1)   
 a - weak node transmit signal -> Gateway received signal's RSSI is constantly < -110dBm.  
 b - OTTA activations can only be archieved during nighttime.  
 2) from 1) 
 -> signal issues difficult to resolve on node-side
 -> This project now focuses on b) to d) while putting a) on-hold.
 
 
 *Notes
 - WL55JC1 and WL55JC2 work in different regions according to local radio policies.
